# ChattyBot
My first Java project.
This is ChattyBot, a very but cool project. A bot, whose name and 
year of creation can be specified by the user, asks you a variety of
questions to which you provide input. With this input, the bot performs
the functions accordingly. Being my first independent project, I am proud
of how it turned out and I am hoping to upload more for everyone to see.
Thanks very much everyone!
